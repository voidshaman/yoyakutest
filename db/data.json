      "bio": "\"ERIS is a Sardinian-Croatian duo based in Berlin, formed by Enrica Falqui and Dea Dvornik. These two souls from different but complementary musical backgrounds unexpectedly met at a club in Berlin. \n\nThe rather spontaneous night out quickly turned into an impromptu jam session. Little did they know that their paths crossing would lead them to playing music together day in day out in the studio. Even though their personality, taste and styles are very different from each other originally, their passion for music would coil and merge into incredibly fruitful production and mixing sessions. \n\nWhile they both play complete and rich sounds, the mutual influence between Enrica\u2019s groovy, rhythmic and driving tracks and Dea\u2019s harmonious melodies creates the duo\u2019s unique and instantly recognisable genre blending sound from Techno to House, Ambient and Acid. \n\nTheir debut EP was released on CABARET Recordings and with that Moments EP was created, followed by Champions League in 2019.\n\n\nEnrica Falqui\u2019s journey began somewhere in 2009, when she started to teach herself how to DJ and produce music. True autodidacte, the years that followed were filled with contributions to dance culture with her DJ sets and alias productions. \n\nWhen she moved to Berlin in 2013, she found her sound and decided to play under her true name. Devoting her life to music, she dived deep into buying and creating records. Enrica loves spending long hours in the studio, experimenting, refining, learning, and creating sounds. \n\nHer discipline and dedication to her sound are unrivaled, regardless of the setting or crowd she\u2019s put in front of, she will set fire to the party in no time. Dea was born into a family of musicians, where she was trained as a classical instrumentalist, vocalist and ballet dancer. \n\nYet she felt the urge to go in a different direction and break free from her legacy than what was expected of her. After relocating to Ibiza and Ljubljana, where she became an avid record collector while playing around with the decks. With a sharp ear for seamlessly blending lush melodies and intricate grooves, her sets are always a spellbinding journey through different moods and genres.",

      "bio": "Magda's realm as an artist spans far beyond the typical role played by DJs and producers. \nWith an open mind, Magda will try her hand at whatever feels right: from producing high-quality Tequila to tech collaborations, fashion and art, Magda has created a truly unique, multifaceted expression of herself. \n\nBorn in Poland and raised in Detroit, Magda has soaked up the various characteristics of her surroundings, resulting in a widely-cultured perspective, tuned to see beauty and potential in the most derelict and depressed of places. \nAs a teenager partying in Detroit, it wasn't long until Magda was fully immersed in the city's underground scene. \nIn 1998, she was dropped straight into the deep end; she joined Minus and began touring the world as Richie Hawtin's opening DJ. \nWhilst this was a perfect platform for Magda to show off her talents and develop a fanbase, it brought with it the constraints of an established reputation. Magda was defined as a DJ under the Minus umbrella, but since has forged her own path. \n\nMagda's touring schedule is amongst the most high-profile and demanding around, with regular bookings at many of the world's very best house/techno clubs and festivals. She's proved herself as a consistent, adventurous and top-quality performer, with a knack for bringing tracks together in unexpected ways. \nAs well as notable accolades such as a BBC 1 Essential Mix and playing at Timewarp's live streamed 20th anniversary, Magda has been behind some stand-out commercial mixes. \n'She's A Dancing Machine', released in 2006 through Hawtin's label, was truly seminal. It intricately layered 70 tracks into 16 sections and displayed an almost unprecedented level of energy for a minimal DJ mix. \nShe was later invited to record a mix for Fabric esteemed CD series, and adopted a similar patchwork approach to brilliant effect. Her latest, two-disc mix compilation, out through the Balance series in February, gives equal measure to the experimental and club-focused aspects of her DJing. \nIncorporating music from the likes of Shackleton, Murat Tepeli and Marcel Dettmann, Magda takes the listener on a thrillingly unpredictable listen. \n\nThough solo Magda releases are relatively rare, there's no doubt her ability extends beyond the booth to the studio. \nIn the fall of 2010, Magda revealed her debut on Minus, 'From The Fallen Page'. \nIt combined her love for Italian horror composition, Detroit techno futurism and straight-forward dancefloor functionality into a quality body of work that still sounds fresh today. She has also remixed the likes of Plastikman and Depeche Mode. \n\nCollaboration has become a vital part of Magda's studio work. Cornerbred is the project she shares with partner Daniela Huerta. Offering a respite from normal DJ sets, it revels in avant-garde and real-life concepts, utilising a broad sound pallet and lending itself to live performance. \nThe pair have recorded mixes on Soundcloud and sites such as Oki-ni, the hour-long sessions covering a wide array of styles, sounds and periods, from 80s electro to more atonal works. \nDTR (Define The Relationship) is Magda's edits venture with Nyma, dedicated to 'reshaping, reintroducing and reviving early influences as a homage to the past, present and future'. So far, LL Cool J, Chaka Khan and Jody Watley have been under the DTR microscope with fascinating results. \n\nOn top of all this, Magda has proved herself as a label boss, running the long-standing and successful Items & Things imprint with Marc Houle and Troy Pierce. \nThe label thrives on the off-kilter and the uncommon, unearthing new artists and sounds that push boundaries. \nThirty releases in and Items & Things proudly count the likes of Jimmy Edgar and Rework amongst its roster. \n\nWith a new event series and much more in the works, 2015 is an exciting year for Magda and her fans. Her Maria Pascuala Tequila brand and design work also continue to open new avenues, each of them explored with the stamp of quality Magda has come to represent.",

He has been working hard in and out of the studio with his partner, Rona Budak, on their project \u201cEnstantane\u201d, which functions as both a record label and an multi-disciplinary artist collective. Enstantane 001 is to be released in the second half of 2018, along with an event series and the subscription based website enstantane.io",
